ASSIGNMENT FOR BRAINSTATION

I performed a basic analysis of the attack surface of the company discussed in a case brief. These questions served as a starting point for assessing the attack surface. The goal was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the organization's digital landscape and identify potential areas of risk.
 
Building on my attack surface analysis, I diagramed a target/upgraded/future-state network architecture for this company.
